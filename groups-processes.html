					<h2>Groups processes </h2>
					<hr>
						<p>In Assignment 2, our group worked well together. We have identified several strengths and weaknesses from our previous assessment and the duration of this assessment. Three of our strong points as a team were: 

Our collaboration on Assignment tasks 

A good delegation of these tasks 

Effective communication within the meetings, minutes and the instant messaging Microsoft Teams chat 

New Changes 

We have decided to improve on firmer deadlines for written content and better communication between team members before deadlines and if a team member cannot attend a scheduled meeting. 

Minutes Taking: 

To improve, we’ve decided to separate minute taking and chairing meeting duties. We found that it was hard for the chair to focus on getting down accurate minutes and leading conversations and discussions. With this improvement, we hope to have a bit more flow to our meetings and minimise the time in having to stop to take notes and possibly ask to repeat discussions. We’ve used the same process of having a rotating chair, but now have included rotating scribing as follows:

GitHub Push-Pull Collaboration  

During the last assignment, Sergei and Aileen took the primary roles in developing our GitHub website. Sergei and Aileen both have previous experience in web development and together produced a great website. In this assessment, we have decided to hold some workshops where we can all brainstorm together and collaborate with the push pull function in GitHub. This will help us all learn HTML and CSS coding and ultimately help us achieve our goals to work in the IT industry. 

Set firmer deadlines and improve communication if deadlines or meetings are missed 

While communication was one of our strong points, there was a massive rush towards the due date of the last assignment. This was partly due to the PDF document not being completed early enough for a review, with changes being made up right on the weekend that it was due. For this reason, we have decided to make much firmer deadlines and increase communication several days before deadlines are due so that we can accommodate redistributing the work should a team member be struggling.  

If a team member cannot make a meeting, the absentee should watch the recording and message the group with any questions or clarifications if not understood by recording video or minutes document. 

More extensive use of Microsoft Teams  

We have decided to use the calendar on Microsoft Teams a lot more extensively for this assessment. We have set appointments in the calendar when each part of the assessment is due and when we foresee ourselves needing to start on the web pages. This will help us keep on top of our work and see how well we have forecasted the project. 

Stronger proofreading  

During the last assessment, we found a couple of issues when using SharePoint and converting the word document to a PDF. There were several cases where team members have reported to have written in the collaborated assignment document and confirmed Microsoft Word had autosaved before exiting the program, but found to be missing the next day.  

Another incident was reported when converting to PDF for submission. A whole introduction paragraph was somehow deleted. With more time dedicated before the submission date, we should be able to read through the document together and catch any missing data.   <p/>
