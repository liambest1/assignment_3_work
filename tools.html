					<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
					<p>
					We have setup a Microsoft Teams group in which all our members are part of. Within Teams, we’ve setup a basic folder structure to store upcoming assessment contents as well as minutes and recordings to refer to should any of us miss a meeting.
					</p>
					<center><img src="images/tools1.jpg"></center>
					<p>Links to our Weekly Meetings can be found <a href="https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/3COSC2196Group/Shared%20Documents/General/Assessment%203/Minutes%20Assignment%203/Recordings?csf=1&web=1&e=zCPbFo" target="_blank">here</a> which contain minutes recorded by the chair and recordings in a separate <a href="https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/3COSC2196Group/Shared%20Documents/General/Assessment%203/Minutes%20Assignment%203/Minutes?csf=1&web=1&e=leDo61" target="_blank">folder</a>. Our meetings are held twice a week over Microsoft Teams on a regular schedule, every Tuesday between 6pm to 6:45pm and every Thursday between 8pm to 9pm. We have an agreed upon roster based on our Minutes Chair Process document so that everyone has a chance to experience hosting a meeting.</p>

					<p>For any quick questions/clarifications, we have a separate Teams Exodus Chat room within teams:</p>
					<center><img src="images/tools2.jpg" width="500"></center>
					<h3>Microsoft SharePoint</h3>
					<p>Our main collaborative tool thought this group project has been SharePoint as this is where we have been storing all our work. We use one central SharePoint under Aileen's account that we all have access to. We use a single word doc that contains all our collaborated work, this has been effective because multiple people can work on the document at the same time and it will update in real time as we are all working in different locations and not physically together. SharePoint also has the advantage of being able to store all of our Meeting minutes and full recordings so that any team member that has missed a meeting can easily catch up in their own time. Below are screenshots of our version history.<br>
					Another advantage with using SharePoint is the version control function. It would allow us to revert back to a previous version should the document be either corrupted or missing segments at a certain point.</p>

					<h3>GitHub</h3>
					<p>As our collaborative effort for all data and information was completed within a Word document on SharePoint, the GitHub log of activity only shows the final portion of the already made text, data analysis and imagery being moved into the HTML code and is not a true reflection of our efforts as a team.<br>
					Our Git repository was setup by our team member, Liam Best and can be found:

            <h3>Monday.com</h3>
            <p>We used Monday.com as it’s a free platform that allows us to scale, assign and track progress of work thru various phases of different projects such as Assessment 3, Assessment 5 and the Quick Class Website. It has useful features in providing a Gnatt chart based on below table:
            </p>

            <center><img src="images/tools7.jpg" width="500"></center>
            <br>
            <center><img src="images/tools8.jpg" width="500"></center>
            <br>
            <p>The table allows for team members to be assigned several tasks or sub items, update status (whether it has been completed, stuck, done, etc), priority and rough timeline that it is due.

            Based on the table, there is also a calendar view that provides further a useful birdseye overview on how well we’ve planned out tasks. From this view, we can move item(s) around on timeline if we see that we are overwhelmed or if there is a problem that is causing project to stall.
            </p>
