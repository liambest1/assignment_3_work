					<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3>Xavier’s Reflection</h3>
					<p>Overall, I think the organisation of the group and the schedule the group made to stay on task worked well. Our group leader made a huge effort to get everyone organised quickly at the start and communicated with the rest of the group that got us to come to an agreement to make a schedule to meet up. We also worked well at dividing the workload into mostly equal parts and making sure people were comfortable with the work that was given to them. We worked together well to get everything done by agreed upon deadlines.<br>
					An improvement to be made was our communication towards the start of the project. Whilst this was solved in the later weeks, early on we were very unsure about each other’s timetables and this led to a lot of concern around whether certain members of the group were understanding how we planned on proceeding with the assignment.<br>
					Something that surprised me was the willingness of every participant in our group to find motivation, and keep communicating with one another, without a single person taking over the project. Whilst we had an overall group manager, it never felt as though they were completely in charge and instead, everyone’s contributions were validated by the group.<br>
					I learned that group work is easy provided that the group keeps communication and as an introverted person there was a lot of hesitation from me, about working in a group. However, if people maintain communication, the group runs in a comfortable environment.</p>
					<h3>Ayub’s Reflection</h3>
					<p>Working with the Exodus organization has been a delight because the communication has been excellent. Not only has everyone been amazing individually, but they have gradually worked together throughout the weeks to ensure that work is completed more quickly and effectively. All of this even though the majority, if not all, of the members of the group work full-time jobs.<br>
					My communication might be improved because elements of my personal life have been skewed as a result of my mother being in and out of coma and requiring several operations. And me, as her caregiver, having to balance school and work full-time, not completing much of the job in time for the other members to get it. I am confident in my ability to perform the duties assigned to me, but I am sad that personal parts of my personal life have crept in and prevented me from putting my best foot forward.<br>
					One thing that has amazed me is my ability to go to work and complete assigned group chores as soon as work is done, as well as contribute to the group's broader discussion. And even though group work might be difficult, all members are eager to lend a helping hand.<br>
					One thing I learned is that many individuals from various walks of life are and will always be willing to provide a helping hand and ensure that you and the group succeed since everyone is on the same path to finishing the degree.</p>

					<h3>Maxim’s Reflection</h3>
					<p>Working with the rest of the Team Exodus members has been a pleasure, and we have brought our individual strengths to the table. One area where we excelled was the delegation of tasks. Liam was able to use his industry experience and close professional contacts to deliver a well flowing and extremely detailed interview with and I.T. professional. Aileen excelled as the group leader, helping Sergei make the website and in producing an extremely analytical summary of the industry data section of the assignment. Sergei used his IT background in web development and did a great job in writing the HTML and CSS code for the website. Xavier, Ayub and I were then able to focus on a lot of the written content. This was not planned from the beginning, and it surprised me how smoothly it has all played out.<br>
					I think one area we can improve on in future group assignments together is a bit of extra planning in the beginning stages. Now that we have the experience with this assignment, I believe we will be in decent shape to look to the future and produce some magnificent work together. I have learned how much I like working in groups and how much we can achieve together with different skill sets.</p>
					<h3>Sergei’s Reflection</h3>
					<p>Our group is very organized, and everyone felt that it was necessary to carry out a common task.  All members of the group participated in meetings and discussions on the implementation of the task, all issues were resolved very quickly and without conflicts.  Mutual understanding helped us a lot to do assessments on time. <br>
					I think that the choice of the communication platform can be corrected.  Microsoft Teams is a good platform, but very heavy and takes up a lot of computer memory and resources.  This can be corrected by switching to another system for communication and holding meetings.  Also, storage and sharing of files are quite slow.<br>
					It was very pleasant to realize that, from the first days of the group's communication we found a common goal and mutual understanding.  We managed to avoid any conflicts and this helped us move forward with our assessment. <br>
					This was my first experience in participating of the preparation an assessment in a group.  I learned to understand what the members of the group want to do, how the group works when completing a common task, and how to actively participate in a common cause.  I saw from the example of our group that the desire to achieve a good result directs the members of the group to best work and achievements.  It was very useful to see and participate in the technical implementation of the necessary criteria and the general filling of the assessment files.<br>
					GitHub activity.<br>
					In addition to work on our assessment files, I actively used the common GitHub repository to add the files of our website there.</p>

				<h3>Aileen’s Reflection</h3>
					<p>I think we’ve got a diverse group of team members with different personalities, skills and mindsets. In my opinion, one of our great strengths is communications. We have been comfortable enough to have video conferencing over teams with most of our team members had their cameras on and talked naturally. I believe we have allowed each person to voice their opinions in an honest and professional way.<br>
					I think we may need to set hard deadlines in regards to what work should be done and when as it does put unnecessary strain, stress and anxiety on other team members waiting on work. This could be achieved by perhaps having more stand up meetings in which we address any struggles and concerns in an open and receptive session; however, this may prove hard all of us work full time.<br>
					One thing that was surprising was the enthusiasm of most of my team members to get assignment completed before the deadline. Our team members were understanding of each other’s schedule and seemed to agree upon most items.<br>
					One thing I learned about groups is that you must have more understanding of other member’s circumstances and workload. Some may be open and able to share their opinions, whereas others may be agreeable and go along with consensus. It was both interesting and challenging to deal with both scenarios and I believe we worked well overall as a group.</p>
				<h3>Liam’s Reflection</h3>
				<p>
				One standout good point was how effective and efficient we were at splitting up the work, allowing those who had strong suits in particular areas to focus their efforts there while at the same time make sure everyone had an equal workload.<br>
				There where two point that I thought could be improved, the first was that working out each other’s timetables for work, classes, and time zones as we all have different lifestyles and work schedules, this would result in larger group participation in the meetings. The other improvement would be around setting better due dates for each part of the assignment that way we could all feel comfortable about when each person part will be ready.<br>
				One surprising experience throughout this project is how well we worked as a team via online only. I was expecting collaboration though Microsoft teams, GitHub and SharePoint to be a far greater task without physically meeting in person but that was not the case.<br>
				Having constant lines of open communication is as important as have regular In depth meetings. As this can help with any issues as they arise and can be sorted out before any meeting.</p>

				<h3>Group Reflection</h3>
				<h4>What went well</h4>
				<p>Communication has been a strong point for Team Exodus. We had regular meetings with 2 meetings each week, often between 45 minutes and 1 hour in length. We kept very active in the Microsoft Teams chat as well, with all 6 members often communication at once every day. Delegation of tasks was another area of strength, with each member always having a clear view of the tasks the were required to contribute towards.<br>
				Our Microsoft Word document now has over 320 revisions, which shows how active we have been as a group. This is much more reflective of our group's efforts than our GitHub repository.</p>
				<h4>What could be improved</h4>
				<p>There could be an improvement regarding chairing the meeting and minute taking. The way we originally designated these roles was to have a team member alternate each meeting to do both tasks. Going forward a change we could make to improve this would be dividing these roles between two people so that it is easier for the person chairing the meeting to organise and run the session without needing to split their focus between running the meeting and recording minutes. </p>
				<h4>At least one thing that was surprising </h4>
				<p>One thing was surprising was the ease in which in member was able to work together with the rest of the team, considering that members are in different class group in this subject. This may have also been an advantage as members were attending lectures from (3?) different teachers each week. This helped our team members attain more knowledge from the lecturers and also pick up tips on how to get the best marks. </p>
				<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h4>
				<p>Communication was a big factor in what we learned as a group, and many of us agreed in our reflection on group work that with good communication we were able to work effectively as a group and communication around dividing up the work made the group efforts run smoothly, playing into our strengths. Many of us were apprehensive about group work however we are able to communicate effectively to get organised and get our work done with efficiency.</p>
				<h4>Summary</h4>
				<p>As a group we have a lot of different personality types showed in our personality tests. This allowed the entire group, who have different strengths and weaknesses to come together and support one another where we may have had difficulties. Our strengths allowed us to excel in the areas where we performed the best. Our different knowledge and experiences were excellent assets to our group project.
