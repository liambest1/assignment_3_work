                My name is Xavier Lane. A member of Exodus, the university team at RMIT.<br /> My Student
                Number for RMIT is S3924090. I am
                an Australian citizen who was born in Australia. My spoken language is English only. As for
                hobbies, I enjoy gaming, both tabletop and video games. I have played in tournaments
                across the country for card games and across the state for various video games. I have
                finished year 11 in high school but then left to become a carpenter. After working as an
                apprentice carpenter for a while I decided I wanted a career change and went into teacher’s
                aide work, where I started a teaching degree but realized the industry was not what I wanted
                for my career either. After a long time, I decided that my interests were in IT and so decided
                to follow that, by enrolling in a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.
