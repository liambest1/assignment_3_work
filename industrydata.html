				According to data from Burning Glass (2018) and ABS job data (2016), web and software developer seems to be the most in demand from employers out of our teams’ ideal jobs. Job future growth for all our team members seem to be very strong according to <a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/occupations" target="blank">joboutlook.gov</a>. Burning Glass data also showed that two 2 members have top 25 jobs in IT. Ayub’s ideal job is to be a software developer and is ranked 19th. Sergei’s ideal job is to be a web developer and is ranked 15th.

			<br/>Across all our team members, communications skill needed and is the top skill in demand from employers. Because our team members have very different types of ideal jobs from data, to operations, cyber security, software and web developer, the skill sets are different and varied. The other general skills that are common across all our members are problem solving, teamwork collaboration and time management.
			<br/>The three highest ranked general skills that are either not common across our team members (2 or below) and not required at all in our ideal jobs are creativity, leadership and mentoring. Liam is the only team member that is aiming for a leadership sort of role and with that requires other similar skills in managing a team.

		<h3>Xavier's Industry Data Reflection:</h3>
		<p>
		The specific skills for my required skill set in terms of being an ICT support officer were far more frequent in the higher end of employment requirements. Overall, they were skills around technical support and social interactions. There were not an extensive number of skills required but they were predominantly skills that are in higher demand. However, there were still many skills that were missing from the requirements, and most demanded of those were skills in Java and JavaScript. There was also not a requirement to have SQL. These are all programming languages as ICT support does not inherently require knowledge of specific coding languages, unless outlined by the company employing their ICT support team. Business management was the most required skill that was non-coding based and whilst team management would be a part of an ICT support officers role, managing a business is less crucial and they are the technical support for an already existing business with management already designated to run the company.

		<h3>Liam’s Industry Data Reflection</h3>
		<p>
		The requirements of an IT Operations Manager seem to be placed evenly from high demand to low. This is probably due to the fact that this roll is often a final elevation point before requiring external intervention. This roll also requires to oversee this progress of many other positions in technical roles, so an understanding of their work type is also required. The role of an IT Operations Manager requires a wide variety of non-technical skills as well as this role sits between those who perform technical roles such as service desk workers or developers and those in executive positions or general staff. While also managing, planning and adhering to SLA’s of the team. <br/>The three IT-specific skills that are not a major component of an IT Operations Managers role are SQL, JavaScript and JAVA as these are highly technical skills where-as this role requires more management skills. Three general skills that are not required of this role are Writing, Creativity and Articulation. While any role anywhere would require a minimum understanding of these, they are not a major component of this role. This information has not changed my willingness to peruse this role, this is mainly because I was aware of the scope of this role by watching my operations manager perform his role. While this role might not be in the highest demand this is a role that incorporates both technical skills and people skill, which is something that I want.

		<h3>Maxim’s Industry Data Reflection</h3>
		<p>
		Many of the most crucial IT specific skills for my ideal job as a cyber security specialist were also in highest demand from employers. More specifically, out of the top 30 of the most in demand IT specific skills from required from employers, 14 of these are necessary in my role. This is due to the fact that I will require an in-depth knowledge of software and hardware principles, and any way this knowledge can be used to breach security measures of an organization. Over half of the general skills in demand from employers will be necessary in my role. This demonstrates the necessity for me to not only have a well-rounded grasp of the IT industry, but to also be able to put these skills in practice effectively in a team environment. The abilities to articulate and plan new security measures, with a meticulous level of attention to detail will be crucial as stakes are particularly high. <br/>The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are NOT in my required skills set are Business Analysis, Business Management, and graphic design. These skills will not be required heavily in my role in cyber security as my role is highly technical and less business administration oriented. Graphic design will not be required unless I need to present PowerPoints or share data, which is not one of the most crucial aspects of my role. The three most highly ranked general skills not required in my role are organization skills, creativity and leadership skills. This may change in the future as my career progresses; however they will be less necessary in the beginning. After looking further into the Burning Glass data, I have more of an appreciation for how much knowledge I will need to obtain in the coming years and I am excited continue on this path.

			<h3>Ayub’s Industry Data Reflection</h3>
			<p>
			Software developer jobs are in such great demand that over one million vacancies remain vacant owing to a shortage of qualified candidates. This position is in charge of creating and maintaining software systems that are dependable and efficient for client use. Developers are tasked with the expertise to know several programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, among others, while also staying up to date on technological developments in the tech field to give a better user experience for clients.
			</p>
			<h3>Aileen’s Industry Data Reflection</h3>
			<p>
			The most in demand IT specific skills that are within my ideal job required skill set as a Systems Analyst, are SQL, Project Management, SAP, building Relationships, Business Analysis, Microsoft Office, Scrum, Business Process and Microsoft Excel. This data from Burning Glass leads me to believe that my ideal job aligns to what employers are looking for, which would hopefully mean that I am able to secure a job essentially should I continue in not only learning these skills but upgrading them as well.
			<br/>
			The three highest ranked IT specific skills which are not in my required set are Javascript, Java and Microsoft Windows. This leads me to believe that employers who are looking for people in the IT industry are expecting some level of Windows competency, ideally not have to train them on the basics of how to navigate and find files. Javascript and Java seem to be popular programming languages that employers are looking at when it comes to hiring web developers and programmers which aren’t needed in my ideal job.
			</p>
			<h3>Sergei’s Industry Data Reflection</h3>
			<p>
			For the profession of a web developer, employers always require a variety of skills and abilities, depending on the required work and the wishes of the customer for the production of a web resource. This can be various programming languages for the backend and front-end, such as PHP, Java, JavaScript, as well as in-depth knowledge of HTML and CSS.  I also need to know how to create and configure databases, this requires at least knowledge of SQL.  General skills are assessed from different angles, but knowledge of databases, some experience in application development, attentiveness and accuracy are always required.  Three IT specific skills in my opinion are knowledge of computer networks and their interaction, the framework, and you also need to know and understand computer hardware. If we consider the area that I have chosen, namely the WEB developer, then my opinion has therefore not changed.  By the way, I learned even more about the requirements and skills that are needed in this job, and I had a desire to put even more effort and study in order to become a successful WEB developer.
			</p>
			<h3>Group thoughts on data</h3>
			<p>
			After looking at Burning Glass data, our team members’ opinions have not changed in relation to our chosen ideal jobs. We chose our jobs based on our interests and skills because job satisfaction and health are important to us. There is a famous Confucius quote, ‘Do what you love, and you’ll never work another day in your life’. According to Peart (2019), people in their jobs are ‘less likely to experience high levels of burnouts when they have a choice in deciding what tasks to do’, which does align to all of our team members’ goals in life is to have less stress wherever possible since work occupies most of our lives.
